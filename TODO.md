# TODO: Implement Subscribe Functionality in Footer

## Tasks
- [x] Add state management for email input, loading state, subscription status, and updates list

- [x] Create subscribe handler with simulated API call and success feedback
- [x] Add sample realistic student updates (new features, study tips, etc.)
- [x] Update UI to display updates after successful subscription

## Notes
- Handle on frontend only, simulate realistic subscription process
- Updates should be relevant to students: AI features, study tips, group activities, etc.
