# Learning Progress Component - Dynamic Implementation

## Tasks to Complete

### Backend Changes
- [x] Update User model to include `lastActiveDate`, `weeklyGoals`, `completedTasks` fields
- [x] Create new API endpoint `/api/user/:email/learning-progress` in authController.js
- [x] Implement streak calculation logic (consecutive active days)
- [x] Implement weekly goal progress calculation
- [x] Update study note, flashcard, and quiz routes to set `lastActiveDate` on user actions

### Frontend Changes
- [x] Update ProgressAnalytics.jsx to fetch real data from new API endpoint
- [x] Replace mock data with dynamic data fetching
- [x] Add real-time update logic using useEffect and state management
- [x] Ensure component re-renders when data changes

### Testing
- [ ] Test new API endpoint with real user data
- [ ] Verify real-time updates on user actions (create notes, take quizzes, generate flashcards)
- [ ] Test streak calculation (consecutive days, reset on gaps)
- [ ] Test weekly goal progress calculation

## Backend Implementation Summary

### User Model Updates
- Added `lastActiveDate` field for streak tracking
- Added `weeklyGoals` object with default goals:
  - notes: 5
  - quizzes: 3
  - flashcards: 10
  - studyTime: 300 (minutes)
- Added `completedTasks` object to track weekly progress:
  - notesThisWeek: 0
  - quizzesThisWeek: 0
  - flashcardsThisWeek: 0
  - studyTimeThisWeek: 0
  - weekStartDate: current week start (Monday)

### New API Endpoint
- `GET /api/user/:email/learning-progress`
- Returns comprehensive progress data including:
  - Study notes count
  - Quizzes taken
  - Flashcards count
  - Study streak
  - Weekly goal progress (overall and by category)
  - Total study time

### Route Updates
- Updated study note creation to increment `notesThisWeek` and `studyTimeThisWeek`
- Updated flashcard creation to increment `flashcardsThisWeek` and `studyTimeThisWeek`
- Updated quiz creation to increment `quizzesThisWeek` and `studyTimeThisWeek`
- All activities update `lastActiveDate` for streak calculation

### Helper Functions
- `calculateStudyStreak()`: Calculates consecutive active days
- `calculateWeeklyGoalProgress()`: Calculates progress towards weekly goals with automatic week reset logic
